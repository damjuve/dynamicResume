# dynamicResume

## Introduction
DynamicResume is a full native JavaScript project ; no external library are used, just copy files and it works.
The goal of the project is to provide a dynamic and fun way to explore your resume.
User will be able to move into your resume using a character, like in a mini Game

## About the licence
You are allow to reuse this project as you want, just add a by mention, visible by anyone (not only in source code, but visible in html).

## About the app
I tried to build a mini-framework to easily keep the resume up to date. This means some section has to be present to make the application works.

I will detail them later.
